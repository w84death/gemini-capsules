# The Doorway: A Text Adventure

## The Spell of Ice

You focus your energy and cast a spell of ice at the creature. The creature freezes for a moment, but then breaks free and lunges at you with renewed vigor. It strikes you with its claws, knocking you to the ground.

You try to get up and defend yourself, but the creature is too powerful. It overpowers you and claims the treasure for itself.
