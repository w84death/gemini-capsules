Capsule dedicated to flying micro drones

## FPV TinyHawk Pilot
Each day with a grounded drone is a lost opportunity to be a better pilot.

## Backstory
I started with DJI Tello but it was more of a flying camera. Then I got TinyHawk RTF combo and started FPV flying. Since then I'm addicted and the concept took me by storm. I just love to fly. I'm a big fan of TinyHawk... drones.

Flying FPV in Acro mode is not an easy task. But learning to master it is very satisfying. I created this page to document my progress. I hope it will make you interested in the hobby and keep motivated to keep learning.

## My Gear
I started with just a Emax TinyHawk RTF combo with 1 battery :) And I still recommend this as a best starting point.
Over time I upgraded my gear to this setup. It fits perfectly to my flying style.

### EMAX TinyHawk II Race
Best quad for it's size! Changed to XT30 connector. New VTX antenna. Applied conformal coating.
Gift from Joshua Bardwell :)

### Jumper T12 Pro Hall
Super nice, wrapped in carbon fiber, extremely precise and smooth hall gimbals.
OpenTX firmware and can be used in simulators on a PC.
Gift from my Mom :)

### Skyzone SKY02C
Superb quality goggles. Big, clear screens. Good reception and DVR. Very comfortable. Fit perfectly for my European face.
Got it from Sanata :)
