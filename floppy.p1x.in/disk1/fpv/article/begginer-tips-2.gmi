## FAILING

    Never fear crashing the drone. You need to accept that you will crash.
    You will break the drone. It's a little misleading when you watch videos
    online of other pilots. You rarely see crashes. And those happen even
    on the best of the best. Yes, Mr. Steele also crashes!

    That being said the key thing is to get a drone that is rugged while
    easy and cheap to repair. For me, TinyHawk 2 Race fills those requirements.

    When I started FPV I crashed every 30second. After a few months, it was
    few crashes per pack. Now after more than half a year, I can fly full
    pack without a crash. But it's more of a cruising. But when I'm learning
    some new trick o try to fly fast - crashing are unavoidable.
    I crashed the TinyHawk so many times. And finally, I brake the carbonfiber
    frame. But the new one is very cheap and swapping it is easy. I did not
    brake any prop yet. Avan props are indestructible :)

    There is an unofficial rule that if you do not crash it means you do not
    learn. You need to go outside your comfort zone and try new, scary things.

## WATER

    There is one exception to the things I write above: water/rain. Do not
    fly above the body of water. If something gets wrong - you failsafe and
    the drone drops - it's over. And you will lose the most costly part -
    the flight controller and/or video transmitter. It is not worth it.

    Rain and wet grass are less dangerous but still can do the same damage.

    If you end up in the water - unplug the battery BEFORE you take the drone
    out. There is a *little* more chance that it will survive thanks to that.
    Just put it in the rice for a night.


## FLY WEACH WEEK

    Flying each day over and over is not better than flying once a week.
    It may be not logical at first but that's how our brain works.
    It needs time to "process". After a few days without flying you'll
    find that you become way better. I hear that from Mr. Steele and did
    not believe it. But then I pick up a drone after a long pause due to
    bad weather and other stuff. And I was impressed by how good my skill was.
    It happens to me a few more times. Now I know it is true.

    In short - flying day and day will increase your skill just a little bit.
    Making a few days off and then fly will increase your skills way more.

    If you live in a country like me - Poland - the weather just make the
    days off for you.


## FLY SUPER TIGHT SPACES

    My TinyHawk 2 Race is designed for outdoors. Anyone was saying that
    it is way too powerful to fly indoors. And that is true in some way.
    If you want to fly exclusively indoors then yes - use any TinyWhoop.
    But for me, the challenge of flying a racing drone in super tight spaces
    is worth the trouble. I learn throttle management and increase my space
    awarnes dramatically. Yes, I destroy a few plants in the apartment and
    crashes a lot more. But when I go outdoor and fly in the tree branches
    it's way easier now.

    I also way better in low flying / low throttle management. It is very
    difficult with TinyHawk 2 Race as it has motors designed for speed
    not for precision. But flying in the apartment forces me to learn
    how to move the stick very, very delicately to keep the quad just
    above the floor.

    This is super important if you want to hit low gaps under the park
    benches. I always was impressed by others that hit those. I couldn't
    see myself doing that at the beginning. It was so hard to do.
    Now I can do it easily and with confidence. And all of that I owe to
    flying indoors.
