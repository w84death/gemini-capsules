# WHY MICRO DRONES?
Writen on Saturday, April 18, 2020

I started with drones at the beginning of 2020. First with the DJI Tello.
An extremely capable drone for its price (~100 euro). But it's more of a
tool - a flying camera than anything else. Also, it can only fly outdoors
with no obstacles around. And it's as good as the environment around you.
Living in the city in a small apartment it's not good. I use my Tello only
on holidays and special occasions.

Then I found out about TinyWhoop[1] - a micro drone for flying indoor and with
First Person View in mind. It started a "whoop" category. Small drones make the
pilot feel like a little insect flying around the house. As with all the hobbies
it instantly becomes a competition with racing around caffess[2] and small
racing traks[3].

That instantly loved the idea. I can fly at home, take the whole pack in a small
bag outside whenever I go to the park. I can fly over the trees, under benches.
I can feel free!
