# Raspberry Pi VNC Configuration

Stock Raspberry Pi OS cames with VNC preloaded. All you need to do is run raspi-config and turn VPN on. That's it.

But there is a problem. It is a propyretary software and it's defaut configuration prevents connecting with anything other that they crappy application.

You try to login to your Pi and you get this error:

> Unknown authentication scheme from VNC server: 13, 5, 6, 130, 192

Furtunately there is a simple fix for that.

## Configuring Pi
Dive into the terminal.

### Set VNC password
Just run this and confirm new password.
```
sudo vncpasswd -service
```

### Change authentication scheme
You need to edit the main configuration file:
```
sudo nano /root/.vnc/config.d/vncserver-x11
```

and add/change the following line:
```
Authentication=VncAuth
```

### Restart
Now you can restart the Pi or just the service:
```
sudo systemctl restart vncserver-x11-serviced
```

Done
