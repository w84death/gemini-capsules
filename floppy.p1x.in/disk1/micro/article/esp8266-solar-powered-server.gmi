# ESP8266: Solar Powered Server

## Low-tech, High-life
In true low-tech fasion I'm hosting this micro capsule from a €1 microcomputer powered by a solar energy!

Solar-powered means that it is ON-LINE only when there is enough sun thru the day to recharge the battery.

> It's a proof-of-concept an a little poligon. My end goal is to have small, cheap and realiable device to host gemini capsules in the rural areas.
