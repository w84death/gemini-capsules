I started programming as a kid on a Intel 486 PC. It was DOS and QBASIC. Since then I made insane amount of projects related to Computer Graphics and Programming.

I'm a Professional Game Developer and Project Manager. Thanks to years of experience in game and IT industry I know how to create and handle small to big projects.

I manage the whole process of product desing and development. From estimating the cost and man power need to delivery final product on time. I code in JavaScript (ThreeJS, ImpactJS), C# (Unity), GDScript (Godot) and Blueprints (Unreal Engine).

After hours I fly FPV racing drones and learing Blender to become 3D Generalist.
