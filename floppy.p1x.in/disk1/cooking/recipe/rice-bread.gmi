=> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathiri Pathiri/Wikipedia

## Ingridients
* Rice 🍚
* Rice flour 🍚
* Corn flour 🌽
* Honey 🍯 (or vegan replacement like Maple Syrup)
* Olive oil 🫒
* Salt 🧂
* Pepper 🌶️
* Rice drink (milk replacement) 🥛
* Chia seeds

## Recipe
First made the rice for sushi 🍣. But even more wet and overcooked
a little bit. Put chia seeds in water to soak while rice is in the
making. Take the rice to cool down. Add rice and corn flour in 1:1 mix.
 Add the rest of the ingredients and mix it up. Add good amount of oil.
 The dough should be wet and soft but holds a spoon 🥄 straight.

Warm up the pan 🍳 and add sufficient oil 🫒. Put a few small pieces of
dough and form pancakes 🥞. Fry on both sides until golden/little brown.

Use this as normal bread sandwiches 🥪. Peanut butter 🥜🧈 and honey 🍯.
Cheese 🧀 and tomatoes 🍅. You get the idea.
