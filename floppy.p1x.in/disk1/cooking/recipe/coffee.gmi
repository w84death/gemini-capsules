# Coffee ☕ around the world 🌍
Coffee is known to anyone in the world. It's the most used drug.
Let's make it more exciting by trying recipes from around the world. I choose
only those I like and drinking often. They are easy to make with common
ingredients.

Each of the recipes includes espresso and some unusual addition.
It speaks for itself how to prepare it :)
