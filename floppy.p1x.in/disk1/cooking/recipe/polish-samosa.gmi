# Polish Samosa 🥟
## Ingridients
### Crust
* Potatoes 🥔
* Wheat flour
* Olive oil 🫒
* Salt 🧂
* Pepper 🌶️
* Chia seeds
### Stuffing
* Cucumber 🥒
* Zucchini
* Carrots 🥕
* Canned Green pea 🥫

## Recipe
Peel potatoes 🥔 and carrots 🥕 and cut into small pieces.
Put to boiling water 💧 and boil till soft (~10min). Soak chia seed with
little water. Take the potatoes and smash them good. Add flour and a lot of
olive oil 🫒. Also some salt 🧂, pepper 🌶️ and soaked chia seed. Mix and knead
until the dough is stiff. Add olive oil or flour if needed. Put for a few
minutes aside.
Take carrots and all other veggies and add olive oil and spices. Mix it all.
Prepare pan 🍳 with a lot of olive oil 🫒. Make it hot ♨️.
Now take the dough and make small pancakes. Put a hand of veggies on the
center and file to form a cone/dumpling 🥟. Put into the pan 🍳 and fry
from both sides until golden brown.

If all went well the samosa pieces should have hard shells with a very
soft inside. Almost like a cheese 🧀.
