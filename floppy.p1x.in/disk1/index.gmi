# Floppy Capsule

## You ðŸ§” are in a dim room.

You see a lot of computer related hardware all over the place. Smaller and bigger.
A dot-matrix printer in the corner. Few transparent boxes full of cables.

There is a desk and a big computer in front of you that just screams "hack me!".
It's a PC tower with a lot of blinking lights. It's fans hums smoothly in the background, thickening the atmosphere even more. The desk is occupied by usual, boring computer stuff.

## Familiar blue rectangle turns your attention.

You came closer and find out it's an old, 3.5" floppy disk.

``` Floppy

```

It's made of a blue plastic and the description reads:
> DATA DISK; P1X CAPSULE

Coincidently, the computer have an empty floppy drive installed. Just waiting to be filled with magnetic data.
