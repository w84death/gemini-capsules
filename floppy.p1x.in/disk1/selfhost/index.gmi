# Selfhoting Homelab Servers
Instead of giving my data to some cloud provider I prefer to run my own servers. It's a fascinating hobby that force me to learn so many things. Keeping all those services up and running may feel overhelming for newcomers.
> What looks like lot of problems at begining turns out to be a pease of mind in the end
Good servers and stable open source software once run keeps running forever. You just need to find the tools that suits your need and expertise. I hope that informations published here will help and inspire you to try!

Since I was young I was fascinated by the big computers. Most likly somekind of a server. I only dreamed about mineframes. I never saw one in real life.
In one of my first jobs I was doing a help desk stuff. One of them was to path-cross cables for internal phone line. So at one end I needed to actually touch the server rack. In actual server room. Only few people can enter it using magnetic cards. It was then that I know I will have one off those. Sooner or later.

It take few years but I got my trusty IBM ServerX.

## From cloud to home rack
The story how I started my home lab server is quite intresting and worth to share.

TBC.

What the story will cover:
* Some shady, cheap server outhere
* Locked account and data
* Raspberry Pi 2011
* Dual setup and more PIs (friends)
* First IBM ServerX
* Second IBM ServerX
* ESP8266
* Raspberry Pi 4
* Retairment of the first IBM ServerX

## IBM SystemX x3570 M3 - The Main P1X
This is a real power horse. It is engineered perfectly and with years of experience. You feel it in every aspect - hardware and software.
Runs on Ubuntu LTS Server.
* Dual Intel Xeon E5645 (12) @ 1.600GHz
* 32GB memory
* 4x SAS HDD RAID
* NVIDIA Quadro K620
* 40" NEC Monitor
* Microlab Stereo

## IBM SystemX x3250 - Vault (NAS)
Soon to be retired and replaced by a Raspberry Pi.
Runs on OpenMediaVault OS.
* Intel Xeon 3040 (2) @1.86Ghz
* 4GB memory
* 2TB disk

## Raspberry Pi
My current poligon for what will be a next chapter in my server lab.
Instead of one or few big servers that takes a lot of power and space I would like to have many Raspberry Pis dedicated to individual services.

Rough plan that I started implementing:
* Raspberry Pi 2011 - Gemini capsules (sites)
* Raspberry Pi 3 - HTTP sites
* Raspberry Pi 4 - Nextcloud, ghost, jellyfin, etc.
* Raspberry Pi 2 - 3D Printer
* Raspberry Pi 2/3 - NAS

## ESP8266
As silly it may looks I got two microcontrollers (in a size of a post stamp) that hosts legitimate websites. Small and optimized but still.
* https://esp8266.p1x.in HTTP site
* gemini://floppy.p1x.in:8266 Gemini capsule (solar powered when possible)
